A student of plant ecophysiology, he joined the Spectranomics team to analyze how genes and the environment interact to determine the expression of plant traits, like growth rates and defense strategies, as well as how to measure those traits with remote sensing. He then joined the Airborne Observatory team to coordinate, collect & process data from it’s airborne ecology missions, spanning nine deployments in five countries. They linked field and airborne trait measurements, mapping plant diversity in fine detail, then at unprecedented scales with satellite data to identify opportunities to conserve unique forests across the Amazon.

He will integrate the projections with fuel conditions and tree mortality maps for the State. Dr. Battles’ research seeks to understand the dynamic response of forest communities to disturbances and perturbations such as air pollution, invasive species, forest management, extreme drought, and fire. His recent work has focused on understanding the interactions among disturbances in order to assess their potential to reshape forests. As a key indicator of ecosystem function, he tracks how disturbance and recovery influence carbon cycling and storage.

                                                            Janice is the Extreme Weather (Workgroup #10) Lead. Specific responsibilities include identifying instrumentation and data sources to identify critical variables and scenarios as they relate to electricity assets, analyzing historical fire events with a broad approach to identify danger spots and further analyzing these danger spots with a fine-scale, targeted approach to quantify wind underestimates in forecast and mesonet data. She will collect historical data on all large fire events and major fire events, identifying critical scenarios, and refining the analysis with a targeted approach to identify flow regimes and sets of conditions that drive types of major fire events. Janice has 25 years of experience studying wildland fire dynamics and phenomena using coupled weather-fire computer simulation models and ground-based and airborne infrared imagery of wildland fire dynamics. Other experience includes numerical modeling of airflow, precipitation, and turbulence over complex terrain and weather forecasting systems. She has developed two coupled weather-fire models — CAWFE and the WRF-Fire module in WRF — and has used them with satellite active fire detection data to investigate major wildfire events and forecast fire growth.

Owen will design the statistical approaches to categorize fires, and link them to weather patterns.  He will ensure that model and data products from the long-term modeling efforts are incorporated in Cal-Adapt appropriately. Owen will work to ensure that weather and climate data feeding model development are in line with CEC-favored products and Fifth Assessment scenarios. Owen received his bachelor of science degree from Cornell University and his doctorate in marine and atmospheric sciences from Stony Brook University.  He is an experienced project manager with scientific expertise in global climate and is comfortable analyzing a wide range of data, from He will work on developing wood cycles and fuel projections. He will integrate the projections with fuel conditions and tree mortality maps for the State. Dr. Battles’ research seeks to understand the dynamic response of forest communities to disturbances and perturbations such as air pollution, invasive species, forest management, extreme drought, and fire. His recent work has focused on understanding the interactions among disturbances in order to assess their potential to reshape forests. As a key indicator of ecosystem function, he tracks how disturbance and recovery influence carbon cycling and storage.chemical data to climate models to remote sensing data.

His role will be to assist teams in the development of near-term risk forecasts. He will deliver advice on integration of risk forecasts into fire management and wildfire mitigation plans for IOUs and will assist in on-the-ground validation of these forecasts. Phil is a 22-year veteran of the California Fire Service with robust experience in wildland fire suppression and mitigation. In addition, he has extensive experience in wildland fuels mitigation, (e.g., prescribed fire) and is able to predict how the impact of wildland fires might be reduced through the use of prescribed fire. His current work finds him providing service and guidance to a diversity of clients including private landowners, federal, state, and local government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as well as educational and tribal institutions.

Specific responsibilities include: 1) compile historical and/or planning-related industry and utility data on wildfire risks and on various wildfire impacts on ratepayers (e.g., cost of outages, equipment or property damage), 2) translate the teams and utilities’ assessments of incremental improvements in mitigation decisions into a plausible outlook on events plus incremental changes in mitigation outcomes, 3) calculate cost and benefits of incremental changes in mitigation outcomes, and 4) calculate cost-benefit metrics across the study horizon and evaluate cost-effectiveness of the proposed decision support tools. Mariko is an expert economist with 15 years of experience in analyzing the policies and economics of electricity system planning, regulation and deregulation of electricity supply, and wholesale electricity markets across the US. She has conducted cost-benefit analysis in a wide variety of engagements, including for resource planning/investment strategies, for wholesale market expansion and re-design, and specifically for ratepayer impacts in California.

Todd is a contributor to the Scenario Analysis Team (Workgroup #4), specializing in long-term fire projections. He will deliver statistical modeling, analysis and products related to long-term modeling and supporting California’s 5th Climate Change Assessment. He will develop one of the approaches to statistical fire-risk modeling and then integrate with both the LUCAS-CA and LANDIS-II vegetation models. He will work closely with the Scenario Analysis Team to identify the differences in approaches and the best path forward for fire projections to support the 5th Assessment. Todd received his BS degree in animal ecology in 1998 from Iowa State University. He received his MS degree in forestry in 2003 and PhD degree in forestry in 2009 from the University of Wisconsin. He joined the US Geological Survey as a research ecologist in 2008 and currently works at the Geosciences and Environmental Change Science Center in Denver, CO. His current research combines remote sensing with statistical and process-based ecosystem simulation models to understand the drivers behind ecosystem disturbances and quantify the impacts of disturbances on human and natural systems.

                                                             Zeke will contribute as one of two operational field experts to multiple Tasks where he will facilitate the integration of technical analysis into operational practices. He will be a contributor to: 1) the Extreme Weather Team (Workgroup #1) on weather, delivering advice on fire progression and fire weather events from an operational/field perspective, 2) the Fire Behavior Team (Workgroup #2)  on tree mortality and forest fuels, delivering advice on field conditions of mega fires, and 3) Forecast Tools Team (Workgroup #3) on near-term risk forecasts, delivering advice on integration of risk forecasts into fire management and wildfire mitigation plans for IOUs. Zeke started his wildfire and fuels career on the Lassen National Forest in 1995. He has worked on landscape-scale wildfire hazard assessments for wildlands and commercial timberlands in California and the Pacific Northwest, developed major wildfire hazard mitigation projects, and helped implement prescribed burning projects in the WUI. In 1999, he began working as a GIS specialist on major wildfires. In 2011, Zeke founded Deer Creek Resources, a wildfire science, tactical mapping, and disaster management consultancy. He and his employees have provided incident mapping services on over 170 major wildfire incidents across the American West.

                                                             David will contribute to the Fire Behavior Team (Workgroup #2), Forecast Tools Team  (Workgroup #3) and the Scenario Analysis Team (Workgroup #4) by providing data on vegetation and tree mortality derived from high-resolution remote sensing imagery. These spatial data will be integrated with field-collected data to model future fuel loads in areas of high tree mortality. For the Scenario Analysis Team, he will support the integration of the LUCAS modeling framework with long-term wildfire models and link an improved model of drought-induced tree mortality. David has more than six years’ experience with satellite and airborne remote sensing imagery analytics and scientific modeling in ecological contexts. His expertise is in forest ecology, conservation policy, remote sensing of forest carbon, land-use mapping, machine learning analytics, and high-performance computing. David worked closely with USGS to integrate wildfire and drought-induced tree mortality into the LUCAS model framework, as well as building alternative scenarios for land management, including scenarios for reduced wildfire severity. He also worked to adapt the LUCAS model to run on distributed computing systems. David led Salo’s work to develop high-resolution maps of tree mortality for the Sierra National Forest.

Dr. Saah has been broadly trained as an environmental scientist with expertise in a number of areas including: landscape ecology, ecosystem ecology, hydrology, geomorphology, ecosystem modeling, natural hazard modeling, remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS) and geospatial analysis. He has used these skills to conduct research primarily at the landscape level in a variety of systems. Dr. Saah has participated in research projects throughout the United States and Internationally. His academic research uses integrated geospatial science for multi-scale mapping, monitoring and modeling of environmental spatial heterogeneity, particularly in riparian, savanna, and forest ecosystems. These efforts include quantification of change in landscape pattern, investigating the linkages between pattern and processes, and understanding the pattern-process dynamic within different environmental management regimes. To complement this, Dr. Saah’s consulting research interest and experience include: developing holistic decision support systems for resource management, assessing natural hazards, and quantifying ecosystem service valuation. In addition, all of his research addresses access, availability, and accuracy of geospatial and environmental datasets, and scale in natural resource and environmental research. Dr. Saah is committed to producing high quality research projects that integrate the most current science and technology. He is dedicated to the accurate dissemination of results from these endeavors through innovative presentations, publications, and workshops.

Ben will develop projections of land use/land cover change, disturbance, and carbon stocks and fluxes using the LUCAS-CA model as part of the Scenario Analysis Team (Workgroup #4). He will support the integration of the new statistical fire model into the LUCAS-CA. He will be developing refinements to the LUCAS model for use in nationwide wildfire risk modeling and will serve as the interface for integrating the latest advances in land-use modeling into the project. Ben has been conducting scientific research on land use and land cover change and the impacts on ecosystem carbon balance for over 15 years. He has authored over 70 peer-reviewed scientific publications. Currently, he leads two large national research projects aimed at developing future land-use/land-cover scenario projections and the impacts on ecosystem carbon balance.

Stephens’ areas of expertise focus on interactions of wildland fire and ecosystems. This includes how prehistoric fires once interacted with ecosystems, how current wildland fires are affecting ecosystems, and how management and climate change may change this interaction. He is also interested in wildland fire policy and how it can be improved to meet the challenges of the next decades.

                                                             Leroy is the leader of the Scenario Analysis Team (Workgroup #4). He is responsible for leading the development and assessment of statistical wildfire models and their coupling with other dynamic vegetation and land surface models. Leroy conducts independent and collaborative research on the drivers of extreme wildfire seasons in the historic record using documentary and remotely sensed fire history data. He applies this research to build statistical and coupled statistical and dynamical models of wildfire activity for seasonal forecasts, climate change assessments, and paleofire reconstructions. Extensions of this work estimate effects of historic and simulated wildfires on ecosystem composition, carbon storage, pollution emissions, endangered species habitat suitability, and wildfire suppression costs and property losses.
