                            Upper Air Profiler Pilot Test (Workgroup #1)

                            The objectives of the upper-air pilot study are to determine if upper-air wind data can be used by utilities to improve short-term (up to 15 hours) and very-short-term (from 0 to 3 hours) extreme wind forecasts, and enhance situational awareness during high-wind events. The project team has deployed Atmospheric Systems Corporation (ASC) Model 2000 sodar system near Cobb Mountain in northern California and will explore the potential to integrate the collected data into next-generation fire models and data management systems currently used by utilities for routine operations. To meet these objectives, members from Workgroup #1 will leverage and augment existing meteorological networks with upper-air wind measurements and provide data for use in meteorological models and other data management systems currently used by utilities.
