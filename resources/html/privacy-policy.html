        <p>
            <em>Last Updated</em> November 10, 2020<br><br>The Pyregence Consortium, and each and every individual, entity and collaborator therein; (“Pyregence”, “we”, “us” or “our”) respects your desire for privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about you, whether on our web site, mobile application, or elsewhere (collectively, the “Site”). It also explains why we collect the information, as well as how we collect and use the information.<br><br>This Privacy Policy is intended for individuals in the United States. If you live outside of the United States and choose to use the Site, you do so at your own risk and understand that your information will be sent to and stored in the United States. By using the Site in the United States or otherwise providing personal information to us, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT.</h3>
        <p>
            “Personal Information” generally means any information that identifies you as an individual, and any other information we associate with it. We collect several categories of information, from a few different sources:
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Usage Information.</em> We passively collect information when you use the Site, through our web servers and third-party analytics tools. For instance, our system logs may record certain information about visitors to the Site, including the web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device and mobile ad identifiers, browser information, interaction with the Site, pages viewed, app usage, and other such information.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Information You Might Provide.</em> We collect information and other content you voluntarily provide us, which may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>User ID and password</li>
            <li>Contact information when you register or submit an inquiry, such as your name, street address, date of birth, phone number, and/or email address</li>
            <li>Geographical or location information, which may include city, county, state, zip code, country or other geographical or map input(s) such as repositioning the map view.</li>
            <li>Any information you provide in communications with us, such as by e-mail or via customer service.</li>
            <li>Any submissions or creations that you generate on the Site.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>Non-Identifiable Information.</em> In addition to collecting Personal Information, we may collect information that does not identify you and is not associated with your Personal Information. We may also de-identify information, so it no longer identifies you. We may also aggregate and use such information to engage other activities in a manner that does not use Personal Information and is thus outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
